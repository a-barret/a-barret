# Aiden Barrett

## About Me
I took one of my first programming classes in 2024. This way of solving problems to me was so interesting and by the end of the semester, I changed my major to software engineering and went all in. After more time learning about software, I have learned to enjoy to steps of designing the architecture of software more so than writing the code itself. If there is one thing that I have learned more than anything from this, admitting that you don't understand is the first step to understanding.
